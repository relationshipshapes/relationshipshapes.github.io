<p>i've been developing for many years and am constantly thinking of software ideas. each time i come across a new idea i start to get excited about using the product. i then wonder if there is anything similar? a part of me hopes there is nothing similar so that the idea would appear somewhat unique. but if i find something similar then that should solve my desire for that product. </p>
